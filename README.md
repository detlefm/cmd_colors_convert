# cmd_colors_convert
Regfile generator for cmd and bash colors

Inspired from this issue ( https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/1175 ) 
I want to find out how colors are working in the terminals of the windows world like cmd, bash and powershell.
Are they stored in the registry? Are they stored in the shortcut?

For accessing the linux subsystem I personally use wsltty which is based on mintty, because it is easy to change colors to my needs. But for bash, powershell and cmd to get colors you have to go through a click and error path to make "your" colors.

The first approach is:
To understand how it works.
And the second:
Take mintty color themes (and there are lot of them outside) and find a way to convert them for the windows world.

Everybody who knows the answers are welcome to put me on the right path.
